| gemma3      | 0,3 |    The actual output describes a different tool used for network reconnaissance and asset discovery, while the expected output details Hayabusa as a forensic log analysis tool with specific features like Sigma rule integration and timeline generation.             |      0,0            |        The actual output discusses network reconnaissance tool limitations, while the expected output focuses on Windows event log analysis limitations, showing no overlap.        |             0,0     |         The actual output discusses network reconnaissance tool limitations, while the expected output focuses on Windows event log analysis limitations, showing no overlap.       |            0,0      |     The actual output incorrectly prioritizes report_1.html based on event count, whereas the expected output highlights Report 2's unique detections and potential compromise. The actual output does not address the specific alerts mentioned in the expected output.            |    0,0              |           The text does not include structured sections for each report as specified, nor does it provide prioritization or analysis details.      |  
| qwq          |  0,0              |    The actual output describes a hypothetical IT forensic tool without mentioning specific features like Sigma rule integration or multi-platform support from the expected open-source tool.              |          0,3      |       The actual output includes several relevant limitations but omits key points such as dependence on log quality and limited real-time analysis mentioned in the expected output.           |                |                  |                |                  |                |                  |

| llama3.1     |    0,3            | The output provides general information about a tool named 'The IT Forensic Hayabusa Scan Tool' but does not include specific details such as it being open-source, high-performance for Windows event logs, developed by Yamato Security group in Japan, or its key features like fast forensics timeline generation, Sigma rule integration, multi-platform support, and multi-threaded processing.<br><br>It also omits important use cases such as enterprise integration with Velociraptor and output compatibility with tools like LibreOffice, Elastic Stack, etc.                 |      0,6          |      The actual output provides a general overview of Hayabusa as a forensic tool but lacks specific details such as it being open-source, developed by Yamato Security group, its focus on Windows event logs, and key features like Sigma rule integration, multi-platform support, and multi-threaded processing.<br><br>Additionally, the use cases mentioned in the expected output are not fully covered.             |        0,6         |          The actual output provides a broader list of artifacts and sources than the expected output. While it includes Windows Event Logs, it also lists other artifacts like network traffic captures, file system data, and memory dumps, which are beyond the scope specified in the expected output.         |        0,3        |   The actual output focuses on event count and data reduction, while the expected output emphasizes unique detections and potential compromise.               |        0,3        |          The actual output does not fully align with the expected output as it focuses primarily on report_5.html, whereas the expected output assigns priorities to all reports (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) with specific reasoning for each.<br><br>The actual output also incorrectly prioritizes report_5.html higher than others based on event count and data reduction rate, contrary to the expected output which places it as third priority due to fewer detections.         |
| phi4         |    0,2            |     The actual output describes a network traffic analysis tool, while the expected output focuses on a Windows event log analysis tool. Key features such as Sigma rule integration and multi-platform support are absent in the actual output.             |       0,0         |   The actual output discusses limitations of a tool for network analysis, while the expected output focuses on Windows event log analysis.                |  0,0              |   The actual output describes a network analysis tool, while the expected output details a Windows Event Log analyzer, with no overlapping data types or structures.                | 0,0              |       The text focuses on event counts and analysis time rather than prioritizing based on unique detections or potential threats as outlined in the criteria.            |           0,3     |           The actual output provides specific details about report_5.html but does not include any prioritization or comparative analysis between different reports as required in the expected output. It also lacks reasons, implications, caveats, and assessments.        |
