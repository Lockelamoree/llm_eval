                                                        Report 2 Highest Priority

                                                        Reason: Exhibits a higher density of unique detections triggering.

                                                        Implication: Suggests a broader attack surface or multiple indicators of compromise.

                                                        Report 1 Second Priority

                                                        Reason: Logs a higher number of detections overall.

                                                        Caveat: The frequent alert for “Process Ran With High Privilege” appears noisy and may be a false positive, potentially inflating the alert count.

                                                        Report 5  Third Priority

                                                        Reason: Contains fewer detections than Reports 1 and 2.

                                                        Assessment: Less urgent, but still notable and worth reviewing after the higher-priority reports.

                                                        Reports 3 & 4 Lowest Priority

                                                        Reason: Each contains only one detection type, which doesn’t appear to be as critical compared to the other reports.

                                                        Implication: Low diversity and severity suggest these may be routine or informational alerts        |
