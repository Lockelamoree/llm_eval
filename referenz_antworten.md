|       |        |       |             |     | **Report 2 – Highest Priority**<br>**Reason:** Exhibits a higher density of unique detections triggering.<br>**Implication:** Suggests a broader attack surface or multiple indicators of compromise.<br><br>**Report 1 – Second Priority**<br>**Reason:** Logs a higher number of detections overall.<br>**Caveat:** The frequent alert for “Process Ran With High Privilege” appears noisy and may be a false positive, potentially inflating the alert count.<br><br>**Report 5 – Third Priority**<br>**Reason:** Contains fewer detections than Reports 1 and 2.<br>**Assessment:** Less urgent, but still notable and worth reviewing after the higher-priority reports.<br><br>**Reports 3 & 4 – Lowest Priority**<br>**Reason:** Each contains only one detection type, which doesn’t appear to be as critical compared to the other reports.<br>**Implication:** Low diversity and severity suggest these may be routine or informational alerts. |
