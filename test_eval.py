            The IT Forensic Hayabusa Scan Tool, while a valuable asset in digital forensics and incident response, is not without its limitations. Here is an organized summary of the potential drawbacks:

            1. Compatibility Issues:
            - The tool may not be compatible with all operating systems or devices, such as Linux or macOS, limiting its utility in investigations involving these platforms.

            2. Scope of Scanning Capabilities:
            - It might excel at detecting malware on hard drives but could fall short in identifying issues in memory or network connections, potentially missing critical evidence.

            3. User-Friendliness:
            - The tool may require a high level of technical expertise to operate effectively, which could limit its accessibility and lead to errors if used incorrectly by less skilled individuals.

            4. Cost Constraints:
            - Being an expensive tool, it might be out of reach for smaller companies or agencies, forcing them to opt for cheaper alternatives that are less effective.

            5. Updates and Maintenance:
            - The tool needs regular updates to keep up with evolving cyber threats. A lag in updates could render it outdated and less effective.

            6. Privacy Concerns:
            - Handling sensitive data requires strict privacy protections. If the tool lacks robust privacy features, it could expose organizations to legal risks.

            7. Integration Difficulties:
            - Forensic investigations often involve multiple tools. Poor integration with other software can create inefficiencies or data silos, hindering the investigation process.

            8. Accuracy Issues:
            - The tool might have a high rate of false positives (flagging innocent files as malicious) or false negatives (missing actual threats), leading to wasted time or overlooked dangers.

            In conclusion, while the Hayabusa Scan Tool is a powerful resource in its field, it is essential to be aware of these limitations to ensure effective and comprehensive forensic investigations.

    test_case_frage_2= LLMTestCase(
        input="What is the IT Forensic Hayabusa Scan Tool?",
        actual_output=deepseek_answers[1],
        expected_output="""
            While Hayabusa is a powerful tool for Windows event log analysis and threat hunting, it has certain limitations that users should be aware of:

                        
            1. Limited Scope to Windows Event Logs

            Hayabusa is specifically designed for analyzing Windows event logs (EVTX files). It does not process other forensic artifacts such as memory dumps, disk images, or registry hives.

            ---

            2. Dependence on Log Quality

            The effectiveness of Hayabusa relies heavily on the availability and quality of Windows event logs. If logging is misconfigured or logs are incomplete, the tool's ability to detect threats diminishes.

            ---

            3. Complexity in Rule Management

            While Hayabusa supports Sigma rules, managing and customizing these rules can be complex. Users may need to convert Sigma rules to Hayabusa-compatible formats and ensure proper field mappings, which can be time-consuming.

            ---

            4. Performance on Large Datasets

            Processing extensive log datasets can be resource-intensive. Although Hayabusa supports multi-threading, analyzing large volumes of logs may still impact performance and require significant system resources.

            ---

            5. Learning Curve for Advanced Features

            Utilizing Hayabusa's advanced features, such as custom rule creation and integration with other tools, may require a deeper understanding of its functionalities and configurations.

            ---

            6. Limited Real-Time Analysis

            Hayabusa is primarily designed for post-event analysis. While it can be integrated with tools like Velociraptor for more proactive monitoring, it does not inherently provide real-time threat detection capabilities.

            ---

            7. Integration Challenges

            Some users have noted difficulties integrating Hayabusa with other tools and platforms, which can hinder seamless workflows in complex environments.

            ---

            Understanding these limitations is crucial for effectively incorporating Hayabusa into your cybersecurity toolkit and ensuring it complements other tools and practices in your incident response strategy.
